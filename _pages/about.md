I study **firms' behaviour** to draw **macroeconomic implications** in the field of innovation, productivity growth, competition and macro finance.  

My PhD thesis is focused on the implications of the **rising importance of intangible capital** in modern economies. In my first chapter I study how tacit knowledge shapes the bargaining power of workers in negotiating higher wages when they are emplpyed in firms that rely more on intangible capital. In my second chapter I study how increasing adoption of intangible assets at the firm level helps explaining declining corporate leverage and increasing cash accumulation in recent decades.

During my PhD I have contributed in developing the [CompNet Micro Data Infrastructure (MDI)](https://www.comp-net.org/eu-technical-support-instrument-tsi/data/) in the context of the [EU Technical Support Instrument](https://www.comp-net.org/eu-technical-support-instrument-tsi/overview/).
